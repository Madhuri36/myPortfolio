          My approach is driven by intentional design, scalable engineering, and
          deep problem understanding. As a full-stack developer and an AI/ML
          enthusiast, I build modern web experiences that balance performance,
          usability, and long-term impact. I focus on creating work that looks
          refined, functions seamlessly, and delivers real value through
          thoughtful execution and attention to detail.
