## Why I Built This

I didn't want a typical portfolio with static sections and predictable layouts.

This project is my attempt to build something more immersive — where motion, layout, and interaction work together to make the experience feel seamless and intentional. It's a space to experiment with animation engineering, visual depth, and structured frontend architecture.


## Tech Stack
* **Core:** React
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Motion:** Framer Motion & GSAP
* **Visuals:** Custom Grainy Gradients & SVG Noise Filters


##  Key Features

* **Cinematic Motion:** Staggered reveals and scroll-velocity triggers powered by Framer Motion and GSAP.
* **Organic Textures:** Implementation of custom-built grain gradients and fractal noise layers to create visual depth.
* **Architectural Typography:** Use of oversized, background-integrated type for a modern, studio-inspired hierarchy.
* **Fluid Transitions:** Custom cursor logic and smooth-scroll interactions designed for a seamless user journey.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Fully fluid layouts optimized for everything from mobile devices to 4K displays.
